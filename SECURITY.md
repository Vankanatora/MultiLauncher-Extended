## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities to keep **MultiLauncher-Extended** secure for everyone. To report a vulnerability, please use GitHubâ€™s [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Vankanatora/MultiLauncher-Extended/security/advisories) feature. This allows for a private discussion about the vulnerability with the repository maintainers and ensures that your report is handled confidentially.

### Steps to Report a Vulnerability

1. **Go to the Security Tab**: Navigate to the **Security** tab in this repository.
2. **Create an Advisory**: Select **Advisories** and follow the prompts to report a new security advisory.
3. **Details**: Please include any relevant information, such as:
   - Affected version(s)
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Technical details or proof of concept if available.

We aim to acknowledge all reports within **48 hours** and work toward a resolution within **30 days**. You will be notified about the progress and any eventual public disclosure of the vulnerability.

**Please do not publicly disclose any vulnerabilities** before an advisory is published, allowing us to patch and protect users effectively. Thank you for your efforts to help us secure **MultiLauncher-Extended**!
